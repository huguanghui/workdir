                <p>Embedthis Pak is a package manager for application components. Pak makes it easy to retrieve,
                integrate and manage components for applications. Pak makes it easy to create applications out of
                reusable application components and to share the components between applications.</p>

                <p>Pak is not dedicated to one language, framework or environment. Nor is Pak for installing
                whole applications. Rather, Pak is an agnostic, application component package manager.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Pak?</h2>
            <p>Existing package managers like <a href="http://npmjs.org">NPM</a> and
            <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a> are excellent, but these package managers
            are typically tuned specific environments and not for general application creation.</p>

            <p>Further, when installing, these package managers will simply dump package contents into a directory
            and provide no means of customizing how the package contents are installed. Pak allows you
            to <b>control</b> and customize how package contents are installed and integrated into your application. </p>
