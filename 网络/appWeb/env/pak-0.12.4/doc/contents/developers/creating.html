            <h1>Creating Packages</h1>

            <p>Packages are defined by a <em>pak.json</em> file that specifies a package. It defines the
                package name, version, author details and dependencies. The format is specified by
                <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.1">CommonJS</a> and also used by
                the <a href="http://npmjs.org">NPM package.json</a> file.</p>

            <h2>Creating pak.json</h2>
            <p>You can create a pak.json file with <em>pak init</em>
            <pre class="code">$ pak init</pre>

            <p>This will generate a stub pak.json that you can edit to reflect the details of your package.
            <p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code">{
    <b>"name": "Package name - one word"</b>
    "description": "Package description - one line"
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "keywords": [
        "comms", "websockets", "sockets", "ssl",
    ],
    "author": {
        "name": "Your name",
        "email": "Your email",
        "url": "Your web site"
    },
    "bugs": {
        "email": "name@example.com",
        "url": "http://example.com/bugs"
    },
    "license": "GPL",
    "dependencies": {
        "jquery": "1.9.x",
        "angular": "~1.2",
    },
    "files": [
        "dist/**"
    ],
    "ignore": [
        "*.tmp"
    ],
    "import": true,
    "profile": "debug"
}</pre>
            <p>At a minimum, a pak.json must have a <em>name</em>, <em>description</em> and <em>version</em>.
            Other fields are optional. Versions follow the <a href="http://semver.org">Semver 2</a> standard. i.e.
            major.minor.patch[-pre-release]. See <a href="../users/versions.html">Package Versions</a>
            for more details.</p>
            <h2>Standard Fields</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>dependencies &mdash; List of packages and the acceptable versions. Version fields may include
                        expressions that describe a range of acceptable versions. For example:</p>
                    <table title="versions" class="ui celled table segment">
                        <thead>
                            <tr>

                                <th>Description</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr><td>version</td><td>(allows prereleases)</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>^version</td><td>(same as &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0, does not allow prereleases)</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>~version</td><td>(same as &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0, allows prereleases)</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>1.2.X </td><td> (any version starting with 1.2 (allows prereleases)</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, ==, != version</td><td>Version expression</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>expression || expression </td><td>either expression qualifies</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>expression &amp;&amp; expression </td><td>both expressions must qualify</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>expression expression </td><td>same as &amp;&amp;</td></tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>files &mdash; list of files to include when caching and installing the package. These are
                    applied before considering export definitions.</li>
                <li>ignore &mdash; list of files to exclude when caching and installing the package. These are
                    applied before considering export definitions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pak Configuration Properties</h2>
            <p>All property names under the <em>pak</em> property are reserved. If you need custom configuration
            settings for your application, you should create your own unique top-level pak.json property.</p>

            <table class="ui celled table" title="configuration">
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>blend</td><td>Properties to blend from a package into the application pak.json when
                        installing the package.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>export</td><td>Export instructions to export package files from the <em>paks</em> directory
                        into the application's <em>lib</em> directory.</td></tr>

                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Selecting Package Files</h2>
            <p>When creating a package, you need to specify which files should go into the package. Often you have
            local files that you do not want to publish. Use the <em>files</em> property to specify the files that should
            be in the package and use the <em>ignore</em> property to specify the files to keep out. These properties
            may be filename patterns that optionally include wild cards, or they may be arrays of patterns. For example:</p>
            <pre class="code">{
    "files": [
        "dist/js/*",
        "dist/css/*",
        "dist/less/**",
        "!dist/less/demo/**"
    ]
    "ignore": [
        "*.tmp"
    ]
}</pre>
            <p>You can use the <em>**</em> wild card to match files in all subdirectories, and use <em>!</em> to negate a
            pattern and exclude files from the set. When Pak publishes a package, it will always include
            the <em>pak.json</em>, <em>README.md</em> and <em>LICENSE.md</em> files. You do not need
            to specify these files.</p>

            <h3>Locations</h3>
            <p>During package installation, the package contents will be cached under
                    <em>~/.paks/PACKAGE/ACCOUNT/VERSION</em>,

            where PACKAGE is the name of the package, ACCOUNT is the GitHub account name or @npm if the package is being
            hosted on NPM. Once installed in an application, the package files will be saved under the
            <em>paks/PACKAGE</em> local directory.</p>

            <a name="exporting"></a>
            <h2>Exporting Runtime Files</h2>
            <p>Often a package will have some files that are used during development and some that are used to run
                the application. Pak supports exporting runtime files so the application can easily deploy just the
                runtime application separate from the development time files. </p>
            <p>Package files that are only needed for development can be accessed from the
                <em>paks/PACKAGE</em> directory. For example: Less or Sass stylesheets can be accessed under
                the <em>paks</em> directory and do not need to be exported. Runtime files are exported to the
                <em>lib/PACKAGE</em> directory.</p>

            <h3>Export Instructions</h3>
            <p>A package can define export instructions that specify exactly which files to export and where
                to export the files. While this is useful for many packages, it is especially useful when creating
                meta-packages that wrap existing third-party packages for which you cannot modify.</p>

            <p>Export instructions in a <em>pak.json</em> file may be specified two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Export properties</li>
                <li>Export scripts</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Export properties provide a simple, and flexible means of selecting and remapping the files to export.
            You specify the file patterns to export, the destination directory and other optional processing instructions.
            For example:</p>
            <pre class="code">
"export": {
    "from": [
        "src/js/**",
        "src/css/**",
    ],
    "to": "lib/myapp",
    trim: 1
    "overwrite": true,
}
</pre>
            <p>This copies the files under <em>src/js</em> and <em>src/css</em> to the <em>lib/myapp</em> directory
            after trimmming one segment off the path. i.e. this trims the <em>src</em> segment from the filenames.
            The result will be the directories <em>lib/myapp/js</em> and <em>lib/myapp/css</em>.</p>

            <p>You may also use these conventient short forms. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">"export": "*.js"

"export": [ "*.js", "**.css" ]
</pre>
            <p>The export property can be set to a string, an array of strings, an object instruction, or
            an array of object instructions. In the example above, the <em>**.css</em> selects all CSS
            files in any subdirectory. </p>

            <h3>File Destinations</h3>
            <p>The <em>to</em> property defines the destination directory relative to the <em>lib/PACKAGE</em>
            directory for the package. You may use <em>${TOP}</em> to refer to the top application directory and thus
            export files outside of the <em>lib</em> directory.</p>

            <h3>Export Properties</h3>
            <p>The full set of export properties are:</p>

            <table class="ui table" title="export">
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>from</td>
                        <td>Filename patterns to copy. May be a string or array of strings. May include wild-cards.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>overwrite</td>
                        <td> If false, then files will only be exported once if they do not already exist. This
                        prevents upgrades from overwriting files.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>to</td>
                        <td>Optional target directory for the files. Defaults to <em>lib/PACKAGE</em> where PACKAGE
                        is the name of the package. Use <em>${TOP}</em> for the application's top directory
                        and <em>${LIB}</em> for the application's export lib directory.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>trim</td>
                        <td>Number of directory components to trim from filenames when exporting.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Wild Cards</h4>
            <p>The <em>from</em> property value (or the <em>export</em> property if it is set to a simple string)
            may contain wild cards. The following wild cards are supported.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The wildcard <em>?</em> matches any single character.</li>
                <li><em>*</em> matches zero or more characters in a filename or directory.</li>
                <li><em>**</em> matches zero or more files or directories and matches recursively in a directory tree.</li>
                <li><em>!</em> Negates pattern. This removes matching patterns from the set. These are applied after
                all source patterns have been processed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scripted Export</h3>
            <p>If you have export needs that go beyond what can be expressed via export properties, you can also use
            the full scripting power of <a href="http://embedthis.com/ejscript/">Ejscript</a> to create
                custom export scripts. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">"export": {
    "script": `
        let path = Path('paks/jquery')
        for each (file in path.files(['**/*.js'])) {
            if (file.contains('min.js')) {
                continue
            }
            path.copy('lib/jquery/' + file.basename)
        }
    `
}
</pre>
            <h3>Extended JSON</h3>
            <p>Pak supports an extended JSON syntax where multi-line strings can be used. Strings can be
            delimited by single, double or back quote characters. Also, property names do not need to be quoted.
            However, if you are using the pak.json for any other purposes, you may need to use strict JSON with
            single line strings only. In this case, it may be easier to put your export script in a separate file.</p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <pre class="code"> "export": {
    "script": "load('export.js')"
}
</pre>

            <a name="blending"></a>
            <h2>Blending Package Configuration</h2>
            <p>Pak provides JSON blending services for packages to merge JSON configuration from packages into an
            application. This feature can help automate the installation and configuration of packages. For example:
            the <a href="http://embedthis.com/expansive">Expansive</a> web site generator uses this facility to blend
            <em>expansive.json</em> configuration files from packages such as skeletons and plugins.</p>

            <p>Blending is a process of merging a package's JSON properties into the application.
            Blending may occur from the package's <em>pak.json</em> file or external files may be blended.</p>

            <h3>Blending Files</h3>
            <p>The <em>pak.manage</em> property can list an array of file to blend. For example:</p>
            <pre class="code">{
    "manage": [
        "expansive.json",
        "esp.json"
    ]
}</pre>
            <p>When a package containing this definition is installed, the package's <em>expansive.json</em> and
            <em>esp.json</em> files will be blended into files of the same name in the applications directory.
            If the files do not exist, they will be created.</p>

            <h3>Blending Properties</h3>
            <p>The <em>pak.blend</em> property collection specifies a collection of properties that are to be blended
            into the top level of the application's pak.json.</p>
            <pre class="code">{
    "blend": {
        "?profile": "debug",
        "?import": true,
    }
}</pre>
            <p>This will define the <em>profile</em> and <em>import</em> properties in the application's
            <em>pak.json</em> file if they do not already exist.</p>

            <h3>Property Blend Prefixes</h3>
            <p>Properties from the package's JSON file are created, added, subtracted or set
            in the application pak.json file. To assist with blending, properties can have
            prefixes to control the blending.</p>

            <table class="ui table" title="blend">
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>Prefix</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>+</td><td>Add elements to existing arrays</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>-</td><td>Remove elements to existing arrays</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>=</td><td>Replace existing properties of the same name</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>?</td><td>Create only if the property does not already exist</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
