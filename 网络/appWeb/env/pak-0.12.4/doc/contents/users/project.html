            <h1>Pak Project Resources</h1>
            <p>Embedthis developers use a variety of tools and resources to better manage the Pak project.  These include
            source code control and an issue tracking database.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak" target="new">Source Code Repository</a></h2>
            <p>The Pak source code is hosted in a Git <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/pak">repository</a>.
            We provide open read-only access. Write access is available to regular contributing developers.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://github.com/embedthis/pak/issues" target="new">Issue and Bug List</a></h2>
            <p>The Pak open issue and bug list is stored in a
            <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/pak/issues">GitHub Issue</a> database.
            Use the issue list to report bugs, issues and questions.
            Make sure you do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully describe any issue &mdash; don't be too brief</li>
                <li>The exact sequence of operations to provoke the issue</li>
                <li>Specify the software version and how you built it</li>
                <li>Describe your system platform: O/S and hardware</li>
                <li>Provide a stand-alone test case that reproduces the issue</li>
                <li>If relevant, upload edited log files and command line trace</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most folks are way too brief in describing issues. To solve quickly, more detail really helps.</p>

            <p>You may also ask questions in the form of well described issues at the 
            <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/pak/issues">GitHub Pak issue database</a>.</p>

            patches or code from any developer, the developer must first have completed the

            This agreement is designed to ensure that you are protected
            and that your patches can be utilized by everyone. All submitted patches that are included in Pak are
            governed by this agreement.</p>
