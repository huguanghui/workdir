            <h1>Building Overview</h1>
            <p>This document describes the process to build the software from source for a supported platform.
            The source distribution contains all the necessary source files, headers and tools to
            reconfigure, build and verify the software. </p>

            <h2>Preparing the Environment</h2>
            <p>Before building, you may need to install required tools such as cross-compilers, SDKs, and system
            libraries. If you wish to build the software with the support of third-party packages such as
            OpenSSL, you may need to download the source from the relevant vendor and build the
            required libraries for the software to utilize.</p>

            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>To build on Windows, you will need to install Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0 or later. Either the full
            product or the express editions will work fine. You will also need to
            install the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx">Windows SDK</a>.
            <p>Before building or configuring, you need to define certain Microsoft compiler environment variables as
            described in the Microsoft Visual Studio installation. These variables are the PATH, INCLUDE and LIB
            variables. They need to be
            defined so they will contain references to where the Microsoft compiler and libraries are installed on your
            system. The <em>vcvarsall.bat</em> command supplied with Visual Studio is the normal way to define these
            variables.</p>

            <h2>Build Overview</h2>
            <p>The software supports three methods of building from source.
            Building via <em>make</em> is the simplest and quickest way to build. Use make if you are looking to build
            and move on. Choose make also, if you need to integrate the product into an existing make-based
            build system.</p>
            <p>Build with <em>MakeMe</em> is the better choice if you are cross-compiling or
            will be working with the software for a longer period of time. MakeMe offers a more configurable build and is
            faster and more flexible than make.  </p>
            <p>Select the appropriate instructions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="me.html">Build with MakeMe</a></li>
                <li><a href="make.html">Build with Make</a></li>
                <li><a href="ide.html">Build with IDE</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Source trees contain the following key directories under the top directory.</p>
