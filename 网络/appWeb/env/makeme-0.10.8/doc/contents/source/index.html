            <p>The project you are about to build has used MakeMe to generate the necessary MakeMe, IDE and Make files
            to compile and build your project from the distributed source code.
            To build, you have a choice of which tool set to use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MakeMe</li>
                <li>Visual Studio / Xcode IDE </li>
                <li>Make</li>
            </ul>

            <p>First, please read the <a href="overview.html">Building Overview</a> to prepare your build
                environment before building. Then select and option below for building.</p>

            <h2>Building with MakeMe</h2>
            <p>MakeMe is a modern one-stop replacement for Make and autoconf. It can select and configure the project
            features and components to use when building. It can then directly build the project. Build with MakeMe 
            if you want to customize or configure the software for your system, or if you just perfer the convenience of
            MakeMe.</p>

            <h2>Building with Make</h2>
            <p>Building with <em>make</em> is the simplest and way to build, but is non-configurable.

            make-based build system.</p>
