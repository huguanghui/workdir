        <h2>MakeMe Plugins</h2>
        <p>MakeMe can be extended via modular plugins that add functionality to the core MakeMe capabilities.
        These capabilities are then available to any project that references the plugin. Plugins can contribute
        standard targets, goals or scripts. Examples of plugins are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Targets to create installable packages</li>
            <li>Targets to run a unit test framework</li>
            <li>Git integration targets</li>
            <li>And so on ...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Plugins are referenced by the project via the <em>plugins</em> property. For example:
        <pre class="ui code segment">
 Me.load({
    plugins: [ 'configuration', 'package'],
    targets: {}
})
</pre>
        <h2>Plugin Elements</h2>
        <p>A MakeMe plugin consists of two mandatory elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A MakeMe file of the same name as the plugin pak.</li>
            <li>A Pak pak.json description file</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <em>NAME.me</em> MakeMe file provides the plugin's functionality. It may contain targets, settings, and
        may reference other MakeMe files or scripts.
        The Pak <em>pak.json</em> file describes the pak and specifies its name, version and source code repository
        location from which it can be downloaded.</p>
        <p>A plugin may also include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional MakeMe files</li>
            <li>MakeMe targets in any MakeMe file</li>
            <li>Ejscript mixins referenced by the MakeMe file</li>
            <li>Any additional files and resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">
Me.load({
    blend: [
        'extra/subsystem.me'
    ],
    modules: [
        'scripts/package.es'
    ]
    mixin: `
        function log(msg) {
            Path('/var/spool/log/build.log').append(msg)
        }
    `
    targets: {
        'time': {
            shell: `date`
        },
    },
})
</pre>

        <h2>Sample Plugin</h2>
        <p>For example, here are the steps to create a simple MakeMe plugin that displays the current time.</p>

        <pre class="ui code segment">$ me time
<b>Thu Mar 13 17:04:49 PDT 2014</b></pre>

        <h3>Step 1 &mdash; Name the Plugin</h3>
        <p>The plugin name must be a unique name in the Pak online catalog.
        By convention, MakeMe plugins are named with a "<em>me-</em>" prefix. This makes it easy for users to
        find suitable MakeMe plugins. You should also set your pak.json keywords to include <em>"me-plugin"</em>
        Search the <a href="https://embedthis.com/catalog">Pak Online Catalog</a> to pick a unique name.</p>
        <h3>Step 2 &mdash; Create the MakeMe File</h3>
        <p>Make a new directory for the plugin and create the MakeMe file there using the chosen name of your
            plugin with a "<em>.me</em>" extension. Here is the MakeMe file:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
Me.load({
    targets: {
        'time': {
            shell: `date`
        },
    },
})
</pre>

        <h3>Step 3 &mdash; Package the Plugin</h3>
        <p>Plugins are packaged and distributed using the
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/pak/">Pak</a> package manager tool. Pak will bundle together all the
            components of a plugin and then publish online for distribution via the
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/catalog">Pak Online Catalog</a>.

        <p>To package a MakeMe file as a Pak, first run the <em>pak init</em> command:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">pak init 'me-time' 1.0.0</pre>
        <p>This creates a default <em>pak.json</em> that you should edit to describe the plugin package.
        To publish a pak in the catalog, you must provide at a minimum:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Unique plugin pak name</li>
        <li>Plugin pak description</li>
        <li>Plugin pak author with contact details</li>
        <li>Plugin pak repository location on GitHub</li>
        <li>Plugin version</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the edited pak.json:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">
{
    "name": "me-time",
    "description": "MakeMe Time",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": {
        "name": "Embedthis Software",
        "email": "dev@embedthis.com",
        "url": "https://embedthis.com"
    },
    "repository": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "git://github.com/embedthis/me-time.git"
    },
}</pre>
        <h3>Step 4 &mdash; Publish the Plugin</h3>
        <p>Plugins may be optionally published to the
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/catalog">Pak Online Catalog</a> using the Pak tool. This is an optional step
        and the pack may simply be included in the projects <em>src/paks</em> directory without publishing online.
        To publish online, use the pak tool:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">pak publish</pre>
        <p>This will prompt for a password that can subsequently be used to administer the plugin in the catalog.
        <em>REMEMBER</em> this password and save it in a safe place. You will need it to modify or delete the plugin
        should you need to do so.</p>
        <h2>Using a Plugin</h2>
        <p>Users can download and install plugins locally using the Pak tool. For example:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">pak install NAME</pre>
        <p>This will download and install the plugin into the current <em>src/paks</em> directory. The project
        <em>main.me</em> file should load this plugin via the <em>plugins</em> property. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
Me.load({
    plugins: [ 'time' ],
    ...
</pre>
        <h2>Mixins</h2>
        <p>Plugins may contribute scripts that are made available to target scripts or other MakeMe plugins. Plugin scripts
        are Javascript (Ejscript) definitions or functions that are injected the MakeMe Javascript engine. There are two
        methods of adding scripts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>blend</li>
            <li>mixin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The MakeMe <em>blend</em> property is an array of external scripts to load. These paths may include
        the wild-card "*" character to match a filename portion and "**" to match any file or directory at any depth
        in the directory tree. If the filename is not found, "~/.paks" is searched for a matching Pak.</p>

        <p>The <em>mixin</em> property is a literal Javascript string to load. These are both injected at the global scope.</p>

        <h2>Install Events</h2>
        <p>A plugin may need install libraries on its target system or otherwise may need to perform
        initialization tasks when first installed. The Pak <em>pak.json</em> file contains 
        a "<em>scripts.install</em>" and property that can be set to an Ejscript file that will be
        executed when the pak is first installed. Similarly the
        "<em>scripts.uninstall</em>" property that can be set to an Ejscript that will be run when the script is
            uninstalled.</p>

        <h2>Configurable Components</h2>
        <p>A common use for plugins is to publish a component that can be configured by the user to add
        functionality to an existing project. The component will be expressed as a target with a
        <em>configurable</em> property set to true. See
        <a href="configurable.html">Configurable Projects</a> for more details.</p>
