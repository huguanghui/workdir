            <h1>Using Generated Makefiles</h1>
            <p>This document describes how to work with MakeMe generated Makefiles and how to tailor them to
            to suit your needs.</p>
            <p>MakeMe can be used to generate complete Makefiles and projects for building via: make, nmake,
                Visual Studio or Xcode projects. Developers can then include these projects to
                building their code on specific platforms.</p>
            <h2>Building with the Makefile</h2>
            <p>To build with make, simply type:
<pre class="ui code segment">$ <b>make</b>
       [Run] make --no-print-directory -f projects/appweb-macosx-default.mk all
      [Info] Use make SHOW=1 to trace executed commands.
      [File] macosx-x64-default/inc/mpr.h
   [Compile] src/deps/mpr/mprLib.c
      [Link] libmpr
</pre>
            <p>Note the output is simplified so that build errors and compiler warnings are more obvious. If you wish to
            see the full compiler, linker and other build commands, include the <em>SHOW=1</em> option:
<pre class="ui code segment">$ make <b>SHOW=1</b>
       [Run] make --no-print-directory -f projects/appweb-macosx-default.mk all
      [Info] Use make SHOW=1 to trace executed commands.
   [Compile] src/deps/mpr/mprLib.c
/usr/bin/clang -c -o macosx-x64-default/obj/mprLib.o -w -g -DME_DEBUG \
-Imacosx-x64-default/inc src/deps/mpr/mprLib.c
      [Link] libmpr
/usr/bin/clang -dynamiclib -o macosx-x64-default/bin/libmpr.dylib \
'-Wl,-rpath,@executable_path/' '-Wl,-rpath,@loader_path/' -g \
-compatibility_version 4.3.0 -current_version 4.3.0 \

macosx-x64-default/obj/mprLib.o -lpthread -lm -ldl

            <h2>Platform Makefiles</h2>
            <p>MakeMe eschews creating Makefiles that will work on all the possible platforms, rather it generates
                dedicated, simple, fast, non-recursive Makefiles that run quickly and simply for the dominant platforms:
               Linux, Mac OSX, Windows, and BSD. There is one Makefile for each platform. Developers can then easily
               extend for other platforms if required.</p>
            <p>Developers typically deliver these per-platform Makefiles and IDE projects under the a <em>projects</em>
            directory and provide a top-level Makefile that detects your operating system and CPU architecture and
            then invokes the relevant per-platform Makefile for your system. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">$ <b>make</b>
make -f projects/appweb-macosx-default.mk all
</pre>
            <a name="selecting"></a>
            <h3>Selecting a Platform Makefile</h3>
            <p>Invoking the top-level Makefile will automatically invoke the appropriate platform makefile for the
                current system architecture. Some products provide optional <em>static</em> build makefiles. These
                are named: PRODUCT-OS-static.mk. If provided, you can select a static build via:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">$ make PROFILE=static</pre>

            <a name="nmake"></a>
            <h3>Windows Nmake</h3>
            <p>MakeMe can generate a Makefile for Nmake which is the Windows variant of Make. This has a <em>.nmake</em>
            extension.
            <p>To build on Windows with nmake, you need to define the Visual Studio environment variables (via the
            Visual Studio <em>vsvarsall.bat</em> and then type:
            <pre class="ui code segment">$ <b>make</b>
nmake -f projects\appweb-windows.nmake
</pre>
            <a name="modifying"></a>
            <h2>Modifying Makefile Defaults</h2>
            <p>Generated Makefiles to not require the use of a configure program and provide a limited means of
            tailoring the build by supplying configuration options directly to <em>make</em>. These options override
           default values defined in the platform makefile. For example:
            <pre class="ui code segment">$ <b>ME_EXT_EST=0</b> make</pre>
            <p>On linux and unix, you can supply the overrides as environment variables or on the make command line.
            On Windows, you must supply the overrides as environment variables only.</p>
            <p>Configurable components are enabled by setting their corresponding ME_EXT_<em>NAME</em> option to 1.
            Disable by setting to zero. Some components require a path to locate their libraries and headers.
            Use ME_EXT_NAME_PATH to define the path to the component.</p>
            <p>By defining make variables such as CC and CFLAGS, you can modify the compiler options. This is the
                also the technique used when cross-compiling.</p>
            <h3>Make Install</h3>
            <p>If using make to install the product after compiling, use <em>make install</em>. However,
                it is essential when invoking <em>make install</em>, that you provide the same make flags and options
                as you did when compiling. This is because the Makefile will conditionally install only the selected
                components for those options.</p>
            <p>For example, to build and install OpenSSL:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">$ <b>ME_EXT_OPENSSL=1 ME_EXT_OPENSSL_PATH=/usr/src/openssl</b> make compile
$ sudo <b>ME_EXT_OPENSSL=1 ME_EXT_OPENSSL_PATH=/usr/src/openssl</b> make install</pre>
            <a id="cross"></a>
            <h2>Cross Compiling with Make</h2>
            <p>Building a product for a platform different to that of the local system is called <em>cross compiling</em>.
            Sometimes this compiling is just for a different instruction set (say x64 instead of x86). Other
            times, it is for a completely different operating system and/or CPU architecture. In such cases, a
            cross-compiler is typically required to build for the target platform.</p>
            <p>Appweb supplies makefiles for Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, MAC OSX and VxWorks. To cross compile, you invoke
            the relevant project makefile and pass the required CPU architecture as a make variable. For example, to
            cross compile for VxWorks on ARM:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
make -f projects/appweb-vxworks-default.mk ARCH=x86 PROFILE=debug
</pre>
            <p>When make runs, it places the output products (executables, libraries and objects) in a platform-specific
            output directory. This directory is named using the form: OS-ARCH-PROFILE. For example: vxworks-x86-debug.
            In this manner, make can be invoked multiple times, once for each target platform and the results will be
            captured in separate platform output directories. Some of the supported architectures for the ARCH field are:
            arm, mips, ppc, x64 and x86. The PROFILE is a descriptive name chosen by you for your configuration.</p>
            <p>If there is not a makefile for your  target operating system, you may be able to copy the closest makefile
            and edit to suit your target platform.</p>
            <h3>Specifying the CPU</h3>
            <p>Make will use a generic CPU type within the specified architecture. To override the default choice and
            specify a CPU type within an architecture, use the CPU variable. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">make OS=vxworks ARCH=arm CPU=arm7tdmi</pre>
            <h3>Specifying a Tool Chain</h3>
            <p>You may need to specify where Make can locate your cross-compiler and other tools.
            You can supply these via the make variables: CC, CFLAGS, DFLAGS, IFLAGS, LD and LDFLAGS.
            <p>For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">CC=/opt/bin/ccarm.exe \
LD=/opt/bin/ccarm.exe \
ARCH=arm \
CPU=arm7tdmi \
PROFILE=release \
make -f projects/appweb-vxworks-default.mk
</pre>
