            <h1>Expansive Project Resources</h1>
            <p>The Expansive project uses a variety of tools and resources to better manage the project, including:
            source code control and an online issue database.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/exp" target="new">Source Code Repository</a></h2>
            <p>The Expansive source code is hosted in the GitHub 
            <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/exp">Expansive Repository</a>.  We provide open read-only access. 
            Write access is available to regular contributing developers.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://github.com/embedthis/exp/issues" target="new">Issue and Bug List</a></h2>
            <p>The Expansive open issue and bug list is stored in a 
            <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/exp/issues">GitHub Issue</a> database. 
            Use the issue list to report bugs, support issues and questions. Make sure you do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully describe any issue &mdash; don't be too brief</li>
                <li>The exact sequence of operations to provoke the issue</li>
                <li>Specify the software version and how you built it</li>
                <li>Describe your system platform: O/S and hardware</li>
                <li>Provide a stand-alone test case that reproduces the issue</li>
                <li>If relevant, upload edited log files and command line trace</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most folks are way too brief in describing issues. To solve quickly, more detail really helps.</p>

            <p>You may also ask questions in the form of well described issues at the
            <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/exp/issues">GitHub Expansive issue database</a>.</p>
