        <h1>Release Modes</h1>

		<p>Expansive can render web sites according to a configured <em>mode</em>. This mode may be set to debug, test, 
		release, or any string value you like. The mode is stored in the <em>mode</em> property in the package.json 
		file and is accessed by Expansive when rendering the site. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
{
  "debug": {
    "services": {
      "compress": false,
      "minify-css": false,
      "minify-js": false,
    }
  },
  "release": {
    "services": {
      "minify-css": true
    }
  }
}
</pre>
		<p>This defines two modes: debug and release. In debug mode, minification of CSS and script files is disabled and
			compression via the <em>exp-gzip</em> plugin is disabled. In release mode, minification is enabled for scripts
			by default and is explicitly enabled for CSS files.</p>
		<p>The mode may be conveniently set via:</p>
		<pre class="ui code segment">pak mode debug
  or
pak mode release</pre>

		<h2>Deployment</h2>
		<p>When deploying Expansive web sites, you should configure the appropriate <em>mode</em> and run 
		<em>expansive render</em>. All the files you need for your site will be under the <em>dist</em> directory.</p>
