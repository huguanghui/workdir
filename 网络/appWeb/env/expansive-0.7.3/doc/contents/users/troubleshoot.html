        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <p>Expansive has some debugging features to help you determine why the program may not be rendering your
        site the way you expect.</p>

        <h2>Verbose Mode</h2>
        <p>Expansive verbose mode provide detailed trace as it loads configuration, plugins and renders the site.
        This can help pin-point what Expansive thinks it is doing.</p>

        <pre class="code">$ expansive -v
   [Loading] expansive.json
      [Info] Using mode: debug
    [Plugin] exp-internal provides "exp" for exp -&gt; *
      [Load] Plugin paks/animate.css
      [Load] Plugin paks/exp-analytics
    [Plugin] exp-analytics provides "analytics" for html -&gt; html

   [Service] exp from "exp-internal"
 [Transform] partials/head.html.exp (html -&gt; html)

</pre>
        
        <p>Conversely to verbose mode, there is a quite mode.</p>
        <pre class="code">$ expansive -q</pre>

        <h2>Debug Mode</h2>
        <p>Debug mode will dump some internal Expansive data structures on startup and will also display
        symbolic stack backtraces for internal and other scripting errors. These data structures include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meta &mdash; Top level meta data properties</li>
            <li>Control &mdash; Aggregated Expansive control properties</li>
            <li>Transforms &mdash; File type transformation rules</li>
            <li>Services &mdash; The configured services and service configuration</li>
            <li>Collections &mdash; The configured collection lists</li>
            <li>Mappings &mdash; The transformation pipeline mappings</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="code">$ expansive -d</pre>
